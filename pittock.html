        <h1>Pittock Mansion</h1>
        <p> <strong>The View:</strong> Pittock Mansion has one of the best views in town. Nestled high in the West Hills, Pittock Mansion’s viewpoint overlooks Portland’s skyline from 1,000 feet up. On a clear day, enjoy vistas of five Cascade Mountains: Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Rainer, and Mount Jefferson. <br> <br> <strong>The History:</strong> It wasn’t until the early 1900s that Henry Pittock started planning his “mansion on the hill” on property that had panoramic views. Construction began in 1912 and Henry and Georgiana moved into the home in 1914 with eight other members of the family. The couple only lived in the Mansion for roughly four years before they died. Family continued to live in the home into the 1950s.
