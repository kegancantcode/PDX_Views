        <h1>Council Crest</h1>
        <p>The View: At 1,073 feet, Council Crest Park is the highest point in Portland. The park is a quiet place to enjoy a sunny afternoon on the ample lawns and to take in one of the most spectacular panoramic views of Portland. On a sunny day, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams and Mount Hood all can been seen from the viewpoint in the center of the park. It ties into the Marquam Trail network that extends from downtown Portland to Washington and Forest Parks. The History: The parkâ€™s history is as rich and varied as the city which it tops. Council Crest was named as a misnomer, as it was once believed to be a place where Native Americans held meetings. From 1907 until 1929 the park operated as Council Crest Amusement Park, with various amusement rides and an observatory where the water tower now stands. There was a cable car that took patrons up what is now the main trail to the top of the park.
